Hi! I am a postdoctoral researcher with a blend of expertise in immunology, molecular biology and data science. 

  :bulb:	My PhD research revolved around the application of data-driven, biology-aware methodologies to identify biomarkers of vaccine responsiveness in the aging population. 
  
  Now as a postdoctoral researcher, I investigate early immunological markers to identify individuals at risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis.

  :computer:	You can find the R scripts for each publication in the corresponding repositories.
